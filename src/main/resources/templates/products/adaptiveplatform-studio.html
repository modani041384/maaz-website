                        The AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform is a future-proof basis for automotive ECUs. A key advantage of the new
                        standard is the ability to develop ECU applications independently of one another in distributed work
                        groups.

                    <p>
                        While the development of conventional ECUs was driven primarily by stringent real-time and safety
                        requirements, today aspects such as updating and upgrading capability are primary considerations. These
                        involve dynamic reloading of software components, the use of standard libraries â€“ such as for image
                        analysis -, self-learning of functions, and accelerated production cycles.

                        The AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform implements the AUTOSAR Runtime for Adaptive Applications (ARA). Two types
                        of interfaces are available, services and APIs. The platform consists of functional clusters which are
                        grouped in services and the Adaptive AUTOSAR Basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Functional clusters:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-8">
                        <li>
                            Assemble functionalities of the Adaptive Platform.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Define clustering of requirements specification.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Describe the behavior of software platform from an application and network perspective.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        However, they do not constrain the final SW design of the architecture implementing the Adaptive
                        Platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Functional clusters in AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform Basis have to have at least one instance per (virtual)
                        machine while services may be distributed in the in-car network.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In comparison to the AUTOSAR Classic Platform, the AUTOSAR Runtime Environment for the Adaptive Platform
                        dynamically links services and clients during runtime.
                    </p>
